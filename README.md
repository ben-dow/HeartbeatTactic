# Heartbeat Tactic

### Required Technologies
- Python3.X

### How to Run
```
python main.py
```

This demonstration of a heartbeat tactic is built with threading on default python. 
No external libraries should be required to run.


This heartbeat tactic would be analogous to the object detection system on a self-driving car 
receiving data from sensors, and t-hat data suddenly ending. The Process can then recover and continue processing.
